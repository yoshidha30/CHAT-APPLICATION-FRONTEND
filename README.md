# TASK DESCRIPTION:

  
Overview:
       The frontend of this real-time chat application is crafted using React, with the aim of replicating a WhatsApp-like user experience. Built with Create React App, the project ensures a clean structure and easy scalability. Users can set their names, view online users, and instantly exchange messages in real time. The UI is designed to be clean, responsive, and familiar â€” closely mimicking the look and feel of modern messaging apps.


Features:
The application supports live messaging, a typing indicator, emoji support, and accurate timestamps for each message. Emojis add fun and expressiveness, while the real-time typing status keeps users informed of activity within the chat. A list of online users is dynamically updated to show who is currently connected, creating a more engaging and interactive environment. Messages are timestamped using JavaScriptâ€™s Date object and are displayed in a familiar ðŸ•’ hh:mm:ss am/pm format.


 Technical Details:
Socket communication is handled using the socket.io-client library. All React components â€” primarily App.js â€” use React Hooks to manage state and lifecycle events effectively. The app connects to a backend server on localhost:3001 and runs on localhost:3000. Styling is done with modern CSS to replicate WhatsAppâ€™s interface, including message bubbles, scrollable chat areas, and input boxes.


 Project Files:
Key files include App.js, index.js, and supporting assets. The package.json and package-lock.json define and lock all dependencies like React and socket.io-client. The node_modules folder is excluded from submission, as it can be regenerated using npm install.


How to Run:
To run the app, navigate to the frontend directory and run:
    npm install  
    npm start  
This launches the development server with live reloading at http://localhost:3000.
